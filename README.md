# üöó Project: Used Car Price Prediction

## üéØ Project Objective  
The goal of this project is to build a regression model capable of predicting the market value of used cars based on historical and technical data.  
This solution is designed for the fictitious company **Rusty Bargain**, which is developing an app to help users quickly estimate the value of their vehicles.

## ‚úÖ Results Achieved  
- Cleaned and prepared a large dataset containing car specs, brand, mileage, fuel type, and more  
- Standardized column names and removed irrelevant or low-variance features  
- Encoded categorical variables using both One-Hot Encoding and Ordinal Encoding strategies  
- Scaled numerical features for better model performance  
- Trained and compared several regression models including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Random Forest Regressor**
  - **CatBoost Regressor**
  - **LightGBM**  
- Tuned hyperparameters using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV  
- Evaluated models based on RMSE and training/prediction time  
- Achieved a solid balance between **prediction quality and training efficiency**
